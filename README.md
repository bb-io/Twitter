# Blackbird.io X

Blackbird is the new automation backbone for the language technology industry. Blackbird provides enterprise-scale automation and orchestration with a simple no-code/low-code platform. Blackbird enables ambitious organizations to identify, vet and automate as many processes as possible. Not just localization workflows, but any business and IT process. This repository represents an application that is deployable on Blackbird and usable inside the workflow editor.

## Introduction

X is the place to see and join the conversation on what's happening in the world. Follow your interests, share your thoughts, and connect with millions of people.

## Before setting up

Before you can connect you need to make sure that:

- You have a X account and you have the credentials to access it.
- You have `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for the X API.

You can find the instructions on how to create a new app and get the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` [here](https://developer.x.com/en/docs/authentication/oauth-1-0a/api-key-and-secret).

## Connecting

1. Navigate to Apps, and identify the **X** app. You can use search to find it.
2. Click _Add Connection_.
3. Name your connection for future reference e.g. 'My X connection'.
4. Fill in the `Client ID` and `Client Secret` for the X API.
5. Establish **X** connection via OAuth.
6. Click _Connect_.
